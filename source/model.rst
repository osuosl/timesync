API Object Model
================

Below is a listing of the structure of objects in the TimeSync API.

Each object is listed with the fields it consists of. Type represents the type
of data passed; it may represent data types (such as "string" or "array") or
formats (such as "ISO date"). POST Required represents whether "empty" values
are accepted: ``true`` means that values must be complete, while ``false`` means
that values such as an empty string, empty array, or null are valid.

Note that this documentation does not reflect the way the values are stored in
the database, only the way they are passed into and out of the API. For
documentation on storing the objects, see the implementation.

Common
------

These fields are shared between all objects except users. Do not pass any of them in a
POST request; they are provided automatically.
